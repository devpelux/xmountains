> This datapack simply removes the 256 height limit to the new mountains (and world) generation of the overworld.  

With 1.18 "Caves & Cliffs" update, mountains can go very high, in some cases above 250+ blocks!  
If you love build very high towers on top of the mountains, and they are too high, there may be not enough space to build (the max build limit is 319).  
To make things easier, avoiding terraforming before building, the actual world generation height is limited to 256 blocks, even if a mountain "wants go higher".  

This is a good solution, but, for a bunch of blocks, there is an evident side effect: mountains higher that 256 are cutted off (like with a katana!) generating a flat unnatural area.  
This is even more noticeable in a mountain range, in which all mountains are cutted at the same height, resulting in this:

Anyway, even without this limit, mountains rarely go beyond 290+ height, and there is still enough space to build (maybe not that 50-blocks height tower...).  
After removing the top limit you can see the real majesty of this beautiful new mountain generation!  

You will find more higher mountains without that unnatural flat area on top! Only peaks!

This is perfect for those who like to explore and climb higher and higher mountains and say wow... look that landscape!  Without necessarily building towers above them!  
And, if you still want to build that tower, you can simply break that cliff with a pickaxe ‚õè (and grab his materials)... it's always Minecraft!! üôÇ
